“Make Yourself Useful: The Outsider’s Guide to Earning Minutes, Trust, and Opportunity”


Intro :
“From Invisible to Valuable” : A practical guide for basketball players who want clarity, value, and real progression
Written by a pro player who went from invisible to award-winning and player of the year candidate through discipline, structure, and system intelligence.


Corps :
My Core Advantage
I’m not talented-first.I’m value-built.
I learned basketball the way businesses and coaches actually treat players:
As assets
As roles
As ROI
Most players never understand this. That’s why they stay confused, bitter, or stuck.
They think:
“If I’m good enough, they’ll notice.”
But the truth is:
“If I’m useful in the way the system needs, they’ll keep me.”
 
My Unique Stack
I came from Cameroon alone, had no scouting, no offers, no program, lost access to gyms during COVID, and still forced my way into one of the best programs in Canada. I wasn’t given minutes — I earned them by understanding how the system works.
I wasn’t recruited. I didn’t have visibility. I didn’t have guarantees. But I found a way in by emailing coaches and sending men’s league footage. I barely played at first. But I didn’t complain. I adjusted.
By understanding roles, value, and what coaches actually reward, I went from the end of the rotation to conference rookie honors, defensive awards, all-star recognition, multiple championships, medals at the national level and eventually professional basketball — while earning a Civil Engineering Degree.
This guide exists to explain what was necessary, not what was optional. 

I combine four things that almost never come together:
Immigrant / outsider path
No scouting 
No network
No safety net
System intelligence
I understand recruiting
I understand roster hierarchy
I understand coach incentives
Extreme discipline
Multiple workouts/day
In-season commitment
Long-term consistency
Role clarity
I know why working on the wrong skills kills careers
I know how to align skillset → minutes → trust
Most trainers have skills.Most motivators have stories.Most coaches have authority.

I have translation:I translate reality to players before reality humbles them.

Who is this for?
Hardworking players who want uni or pro but don’t know how to make themselves unavoidable.
Not “dreamers.”Not casual hoopers.Serious players with anxiety, confusion or doubt

You don’t need more drills.
You need orientation.

Most players don’t fail because they aren’t talented.They fail because they don’t understand the system they’re in.
They:
Work on the wrong skills
Misunderstand their role
Train hard without direction
Get frustrated with coaches
Don’t know how to stand out
Don’t know what level they realistically belong to
Effort without clarity leads to stagnation.
This guide exists to fix that!


The Outcome I Provide
I don’t promise guaranteed scholarships or that you’ll become a star
I promise something way more valuable:
Clarity, usefulness, and leverage inside the basketball system.
Inside the guide, you’ll learn how to:
Understand your role and why it matters
Train for game value, not empty skills
Communicate with coaches effectively
Avoid common mistakes that stall progress
Stay mentally disciplined when minutes, trust, or clarity are lacking
Build leverage — whether you’re inside a system or outside it

I’ll help you understand how to make yourself valuable to a coach — so your work actually turns into minutes and opportunities. 
With valuable input coming from reputable coaches**.

This is structure, discipline, and decision-making from someone who did it the hard way.
Not being recruited → learning outreach
Barely playing → learning role clarity
Off-season grind → skill transfer
 

“If you want clarity instead of guesswork, this is for you.”

And remember, Information without action changes nothing.

Get the guide and become difficult to ignore. A player coaches trust!
